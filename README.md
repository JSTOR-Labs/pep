# Prison Education: Offline Access Initiative

## Project Overview

### Background
In 2007, at the request of the [Bard Prison Initiative](https://bpi.bard.edu/), JSTOR created a tool to help incarcerated students who do not have access to the internet.  The tool was an offline browser that provided a searchable index of content on JSTOR, but not the full-text of documents.  Students use it to find content to request of instructors and librarians, who are then able to get the content outside of the prison and bring in a printed version.  Nearly twenty prison education programs now have this offline index.  

### Project goal
The goal of the project is to create a next-generation tool to support incarcerated students conducting research without access to the internet.  The solution will be tested with a cohort of prison education programs, in order to make a recommendation regarding how to provide full access to JSTOR to as many higher education in prison programs as possible.

This work performed is paired with and informed by new research on prison education being conducted by [Ithaka S+R](https://sr.ithaka.org/).

### The work
1. A one-day workshop was conducted with an advisory committee of prison education program leaders, librarians, educators, former students and department of corrections representatives.
2. With guidance from the advisory committee, a test cohort of five prison education programs was selected to implement and test the new solution. The five programs are Calvin Prison Initiative, Cornell Prison Education Program, Freedom Education Project Puget Sound, Prison University Project, and Community University Project at Stetson University.
3. A one-day workshop with the test cohort was conducted, during which features for the proposed solution were refined and prioritized.
4. The new solution was implemented.

The new solution is currently being shipping to the test cohort, who will use it with their students and teachers.  The feedback for this test cohort will be used to assess how best to expand access to the program.

### The solution
The new solution offers a number of advancements that will help increase access for incarcerated researchers to scholarly material. Installed on a small server called a NUC that is not much bigger than a paperback book, the solution contains the JSTOR search index, the full-text content for all open access content, as well as workflow software both to configure the system and to manage students‚Äô requests. When they access it, students conduct searches much as they would on the main JSTOR platform, except that when they find an article, rather than click through to read it, they request the article, where it gets moved into an administrative request queue. This allows administrators to review and fulfill the requests. When connected to the internet, the device will automatically update both functionality and content, dramatically improving the ability to maintain and improve these systems moving forward.

Each device contains JSTOR's solution for prison education.
