# JSTOR Access in Prison Initiative

## System Requirements

1. A computer with sufficient storage space to hold the application. For the thumbdrives that do not include any pre-approved content, 4-5 GB is enough. If you are using the thumbdrives with pre-approved JSTOR articles included, 7.5GB will be required.
1. Web browser installed on access device (e.g., Chrome).  This does not require internet access, the application just needs to be installed and accessible to the user.
1. Passwords. You will need an administrator password, as well as a PDF access password if your thumbdrive includes content.

## Windows Installation Guide

1. Copy the JSTOR folder (along with all its contents) and the start.bat file to your Windows device. 
2. When the copy is complete, eject the thumb drive and remove it.
3. Double click the start.bat file on your Windows device. 
4. You should see a terminal window open and fill with text. After a minute or so, another terminal window will open. If you are using the thumbdrive that includes pre-approved JSTOR content, you will be promoted to enter a PDF access password at this point. Enter the password and hit Enter. The remainder of the process will continue as normal.

At that point, you should be able to open a browser and visit localhost:1323. Please note that even after the system starts and the browser is accessible, it may take a few minutes for all content to be fully searchable. During this time, search results may be inconsistent.
5. That's it! Now you're ready to use JSTOR!
